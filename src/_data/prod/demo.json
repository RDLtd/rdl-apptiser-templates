We took over The Pityme Inn in late 2018 & have been working hard with our team to make the pub the best it can be. We have carried out extensive renovations both inside and out and introduced an outside kitchen, takeaway options and even a village shop! We work closely with local suppliers to bring the best of Cornwall to your plate and glass. We are passionate about locally sourced produce & where ever possible this is on our menu, from fresh fish, meat and vegetables to bread, eggs and cheese. Our bar is fully stocked with a wide selection of gins, rums & local spirits & we pride ourselves on our award winning selection of St Austell ales. \n\nWe also offer over night accommodation in our 4 en-suite King-size rooms. We are open from 9am serving food throughout the day so whenever you are passing you are sure of a warm welcome.\n\nFamilies and dogs are always welcome."
